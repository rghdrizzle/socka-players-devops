<h1> Socka-players </h1>
<p> A simple application written in Js and used MySQL for the database . This application can store the details of a football player along with an image. This project mainy focuses on the devops part rather than the development part . I used Docker for containerizing , Kubernetes for Orchestration , CircleCI for cicd , Terraform for provisioning clusters and servers in azure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Containerization of the application using Docker</li>
  <li> Building a CI/CD pipeline to build and push the docker image </li>
  <li> Writing yaml manifests for the deployment of the application using Kubernetes </li>
  <li> Provisioning the infrastructure using terraform to provision an AKS cluster in Azure( created multi enviornments too )</li>
  <li> Improving the CI/CD pipeline by writing a job to automate the IaC and deployment of the application to the AKS cluster </li>
